# Mahitha-portfolio

Helllo!
I'm Mahitha.I'm a 2021 graduate and stream is Electronics and Communication.Being a student of circuital branch,I wasn't exposed to the core part of programming and computers.I thought CS isn't fun.During my 2nd year of engineering,I was part of a Hackathon and this made me realize that there is so much to do with Technology and coding can help us build things.That is when I stepped into Web and it's development.The journey of learning to code all by myself is not easy but it's definitely worth it.
So,This is my Website where I showcased all my work, research and information together.
Let's connect and I respect every feedback for my work!
